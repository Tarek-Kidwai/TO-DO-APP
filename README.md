# TO-DO-APP Generations-Australia - Sprint 2.
Task manager App- TODO App continuation of the Group project sprint 2 / WD 10 Cohort Team 4 Created using HTML,CSS, JavaScript Team Members Tarek Kidwai-Kalai-Alexis.
This code represents a simple task management application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Here's a summary of the code, technologies, and logic used in this project:

Technologies:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the elements.
CSS: Used for styling the elements and defining the layout.
JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and functionality to the application.
Logic:

The code utilizes event listeners and functions to handle user interactions.
When the user submits the form, the formValidation() function is called to validate the input.
If the form validation is successful, the acceptData() function is called to store the task data.
The createTasks() function is then called to dynamically create a new task element with the entered data.
The deleteTask() function is used to remove a task when the user clicks the delete button.
The editTask() function is used to populate the form fields with the task data for editing.
The resetForm() function clears the form fields after a task is added or edited.
